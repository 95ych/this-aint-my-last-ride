# This aint my last ride

Description :
This video game is made by using pure python and pygame only.
It is a 2 player game competeing each other. There are 4 rounds in the game.
Score increases by 5 if you cross an obstacle and by 10 for a moving one.
The score will be saved even if you die in mid-way.
New enemies and no. of obstacles increase after every round.
If a player wins a particular round the enemy speed increases in the next round.
Game design
Controls :
UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT : for Player1
W A S D : for Player2
For better gaming experience :
* I hv declared 4 dedicated variables for up down left and right...instead of 2 variables
* The collision theory used is pixel perfect rather than distance and AABB .
Which allows narrow escape for the player.
